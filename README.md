# Crypto Price-tracker

A small python script to monitor several cyptocurrencies that you wish to follow. It uses the CryptoCompare API call to update the list of cryptocurrencies every minute. Additionally, if you have invested in any of the cryptocoins (or want to set-up a mock investment) the script will display your marked position for each coin you are tracking & give your overall net position for your crypto portfolio.
